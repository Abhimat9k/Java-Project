# Java-Project

In developing the Stock Management System using Java, I applied a range of programming and problem-solving skills to create a functional and user-friendly console-based application. The project involved designing and implementing features that allow users to manage stock items effectively, from adding new items to issuing and returning them.

I utilized core Java concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, and loops. The Stock class and the Items class encapsulate the functionalities and attributes of the system. The Items class defines the structure for stock items, including attributes like item name, company name, item number, and quantity. Methods within this class provide access to these attributes.

# User Interface Design:
The application features a simple text-based user interface. I used print statements to create a clear and intuitive menu system. This menu guides users through the various options, including adding items, searching for items, displaying sorted items, issuing items, and returning items. The use of escape sequences ensures the console is cleared between actions, maintaining a clean interface.

# Data Validation and Error Handling:
To ensure data integrity, I implemented validation checks when adding new items. For example, the system checks for duplicate item numbers and ensures that quantities are not below a specified minimum. This prevents the entry of invalid data and ensures the consistency of stock records.

# Sorting and Searching Algorithms:
I applied sorting algorithms to organize stock items alphabetically by their names, enhancing the usability of the display function. Searching functionality allows users to quickly find items by their item number, demonstrating my ability to implement efficient search algorithms.

# Interactive and Real-Time Updates:
The system dynamically updates the stock data as users issue and return items. This required careful management of the stock array and the implementation of logic to adjust item quantities accurately.

# User Interaction and Experience:
I focused on making the application interactive and user-friendly. Prompts guide users through input processes, and formatted output provides clear visibility of the stock status.

Overall, this project highlights my proficiency in Java programming, my ability to create structured and maintainable code, and my skill in developing user-friendly console applications. It demonstrates how I can integrate various programming concepts to solve real-world problems effectively.
